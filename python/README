# "A Computationally Efficient Approach for Calculating Galaxy Two-Point Correlations"

# MAIN FUNCTIONS
# Python module to calculate two-point correlation function using the method in
# refered paper. In short, the method assumes the redshift and angular distribution
# of random galaxies are independent, and proceeds to calculate redshift and
# angular separation distribution P(z) and f(theta) then applies integration. 
# Please refer to the refered paper for more information.

# Non-cosmology module will calculate two-point correlation using a given
# cosmological model.
# Cosmology module will calculate two-point correlation in two steps. In step one, 
# the components for two-point correlation (e.g. angular separation f(theta) and 
# angular-redshift g(theta, r)). In step two, cosmological model is applied to
# calculate two-point correlation function. The result in step one (which takes 
# majority of run time) is independent of the cosmology and thus different cosmology 
# models can then be applied.

# OTHER FUNCTIONS
# + Finding catalog boundaries
#   - limit.py return the maximum and minimum RA, DEC, Z of each given catalog, and of 
#   all given catalogs. 
#   - Example:
#       Call "python3 limit.py catalog1 catalog2" will print out the maximum and minimum
#       RA, DEC, Z of catalog1 and catalog2, and the maximum and minimum RA, DEC, Z of both.
