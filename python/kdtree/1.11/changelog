Version 1.11:
  - In CorrelationFunction.radial_angular_distance(): optimize Tree algorithms
  The runtime of the Tree algorithms is O(NlogM) where N is the number of points
  looping through, and M is the number of points in Tree.
  Now create Tree using the smaller number of points between galaxies catalog,
  and angular distribution.
