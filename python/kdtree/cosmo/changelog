Version 1.20: 
  - Change to take in redshift and cosmological parameters to evaluate comoving distance,
  and calculate separations:
    + Add class cosmology.Cosmology to evaluate comoving distance from redshift.
    + Change angular-distance g(theta, r) to angular-redshift g(theta, z).
    + Change comoving distribution P(r) to redshift distribution P(z)
    + Now class CorrelationFunction will calculate angular distance distribution f(theta)
    and angular-redshift distribution g(theta, z) in constructor and store as attributes.
  - Replace .txt input reader with .fits input reader. Now ONLY take in .fits format input.

Version 1.11:
  - Change function name histogram2points() to hist2point().
  - In CorrelationFunction.radial_angular_distance(): optimize Tree algorithms
  The runtime of the Tree algorithms is O(NlogM) where N is the number of points
  looping through, and M is the number of points in Tree. Now create Tree using the 
  smaller number of points between galaxies catalog, and angular distribution.

Version 1.10:
  - Add weighted histogram
