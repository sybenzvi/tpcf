# FINDING CATALOG BOUNDARIES
# limit.py return the maximum and minimum RA, DEC, Z of each given catalog, and of 
# all given catalogs. 
# Example:
#   Call "python3 limit.py catalog1 catalog2" will print out the maximum and minimum
#   RA, DEC, Z of catalog1 and catalog2, and the maximum and minimum RA, DEC, Z of both.

# JOBS
# Configuration files should be divided into python configuration sections.
# Example:
# To create section "SAMPLE_SECTION" with parameter "sample_par" and value "sample_val"
#   [SAMPLE_SECTION]
#   sample_par=sample_val
# Parameters provided:
# Required:
# Section: [FITS]
#   - data_filename: Path to galaxies catalog. Should be in .fits format.
#   - random_filename: Path to randoms catalog. Should be in .fits format
#   - index: Index of header containing data.
#   - ra: Name of columns with right ascension data.
#   - dec: Name of columns with declination data.
#   - z: Name of columns with redshift data.
#   - weight: Name of columns with weight data.
#   - weight_fkp: Name of columns with weight_fkp, or redshift distribution weight.
#   - weight_sdc: Name of columns with weight_sdc, or weight from star distribution.
#   - weight_noz: Name of columns with weight_noz, or weight due to redshift failure.
#   - weight_cp: Name of columns with weight_cp, or wieght due to fiber collision (close pairs).
#   Note: Import will search first for weight_fkp, weight_sdc, weight_noz, weight_cp and combined
#   them using equation weight = weight_fkp*weight_sdc*(weight_noz+weight_cp-1). If not found, 
#   will search for weight instead.
# Section: [BINNING]
#   Note: All angular variables have unit of degree. All distance variables have unit of Mpc/h.
#         Will implement unit input.
#   - s_max: Maximum separation to consider in two-point correlation.
#   - theta_max: Maximum angular distance to consider. At minimum radius, angular distance must span at least
#                 s_max.
#   - binwidth_ra: Binwidth along x-axis of 2-d angular distribution R(ra, dec).
#                  If 'auto', binwidth_ra = binwidth_r/r_max.
#   - binwidth_dec: Binwidth along y-axis of 2-d angular distribution R(ra, dec).
#                  If 'auto', binwidth_dec = binwidth_r/r_max.
#   - binwidth_r: Binwidth of radial distribution P(r). If 'auto', binwidth_r = binwidth_s/2.
#   - binwidth_theta: Binwidth of angular distance distribution f(theta) and binwidth along x-axis of 
#                     2-d angular-radial distribution g(theta, r). If 'auto', binwidth_ra = binwidth_r/r_max.
#   - binwidth_s: Binwidth of two-point correlation function and separation histogram RR, DR, DD.
# Section: [REGION]
#   Note: Specified the region of the sky to calculate the two-point correlation. All angular variables
#         have unit of degree. All distance variables have unit of Mpc/h. 
#         If the bounds envelop the catalog, then the full catalog will be used.
#   - ra_min: Minimum right ascension to consider.
#   - ra_max: Maximum right ascension to consider.
#   - dec_min: Minimum declination to consider.
#   - dec_max: Maximum declination to consider.
#   - z_min: Minimum redshift to consider.
#   - z_max: Maximum redshift to consider.
# Section: [COSMOLOGY]
#   - hubble0: Hubble constant at present(z=0).
#   - omega_m0: Relative density of matter at present (z=0).
#   - omega_b0: Relative density of baryonic matter at present (z=0).
#   - omega_de0: Relative density of dark energy at present (z=0).
#   - temp_cmb: Temperature of the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) at present (z=0)
#   - nu_eff: Effective number of neutrino flavor.
#   - m_nu: Mass of each flavor of neutrino
# Optional: Not yet implemented.
