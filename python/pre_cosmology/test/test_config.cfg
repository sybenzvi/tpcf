# This serves as a guide to writting configuration file to be read in class 
# correlation_function.CorrelationFunction. Also provide a sample configuration
# file that process on BOSS DR9 North data.
# Configuration files should be divided into python configuration sections.
# Example:
# To create section "SAMPLE_SECTION" with parameter "sample_par" and value "sample_val"
#   [SAMPLE_SECTION]
#   sample_par=sample_val
# Parameters provided:
# Required:
# Section: [FITS]
#   - data_filename: Path to galaxies catalog. Should be in .fits format.
#   - random_filename: Path to randoms catalog. Should be in .fits format
#   - INDEX: Index of header containing data.
#   - RA: Name of columns with right ascension data.
#   - DEC: Name of columns with declination data.
#   - Z: Name of columns with redshift data.
#   - WEIGHT: Name of columns with weight data.
#   - WEIGHT_FKP: Name of columns with weight_fkp, or redshift distribution weight.
#   - WEIGHT_SDC: Name of columns with weight_sdc, or weight from star distribution.
#   - WEIGHT_NOZ: Name of columns with weight_noz, or weight due to redshift failure.
#   - WEIGHT_CP: Name of columns with weight_cp, or wieght due to fiber collision (close pairs).
#   Note: Import will search first for WEIGHT_FKP, WEIGHT_SDC, WEIGHT_NOZ, WEIGHT_CP and combined
#   them using equation weight = weight_fkp*weight_sdc*(weight_noz+weight_cp-1). If not found, 
#   will search for WEIGHT instead.
# Section: [BINNING]
#   - s_max: Maximum separation to consider in two-point correlation.
#   - theta_max: Maximum angular distance to consider. At minimum radius, angular distance must span at least s_max.
#   - binwidth_ra: Binwidth along x-axis of 2-d angular distribution R(ra, dec).
#   - binwidth_dec: Binwidth along y-axis of 2-d angular distribution R(ra, dec).
#   - binwidth_r: Binwidth of radial distribution P(r).
#   - binwidth_theta: Binwidth of angular distance distribution f(theta) and 
#                     binwidth along x-axis of 2-d angular-radial distribution g(theta, r).
#   - binwidth_s: Binwidth of two-point correlation function and separation histogram RR, DR, DD.
#   Note: All angular variables have unit of degree. All distance variables have unit of Mpc/h.
#          Will implement unit input.
# Section: [COSMOLOGY]
#   - hubble0: Hubble constant at present(z=0).
#   - omega_m0: Relative density of matter at present (z=0).
#   - omega_b0: Relative density of baryonic matter at present (z=0).
#   - omega_de0: Relative density of dark energy at present (z=0).
#   - temp_cmb: Temperature of the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) at present (z=0)
#   - nu_eff: Effective number of neutrino flavor.
#   - m_nu: Mass of each flavor of neutrino
# Optional: Not yet implemented.
